 <h1>What is BookBound?</h1>

<p>A friend has invited you to the reading community BookBound. <br><br> 
Though mobile phones and social media allow us to communicate more frequently, we are saying less than ever. BookBound promotes meaningful conversation by helping users to connect over books. <br><br>

After signing in with Facebook, "Start a Book" to begin. Enter the title, ISBN, or author of an old favorite or the latest bestseller. Select what you want to read and then pick a reading partner. Pick a friend if you'd like to start a bookclub for two. Mystery lover? Pick a stranger with our "Read with a Rando" feature. BookBound's compatibility algorithm will help you find a perfect reading pal. <br><br>

Once your partner accepts your request, you're off! Start reading and remember to make notes every time you close your book. You can see and respond to your friend's notes, but not on pages ahead of your current reading location. Look ma, no spoilers! See all those notes some 20 pages ahead? Better catch up to your friend to get to the good stuff. <br><br>

A type of modern-day marginalia, BookBound's notes will provide a record of your literary thoughts and new friendships.</p>

<h2>BookBound makes reading social. </h2><br><br>
